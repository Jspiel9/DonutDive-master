To run a server in Django, you need to follow a few steps to set up your environment, create a project, and start the development server. Here is a step-by-step guide:

Create a Virtual Environment: 

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for your Django project. Run the following command to create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv

Install Django: Once the virtual environment is activated, install Django using pip: pip install django

Creating a Django Project

Start a New Project: Use the django-admin command to create a new project. Replace projectName with your desired project name: django-admin startproject projectName

Running the Development Server

Run the Server: Use the manage.py script to start the development server: python manage.py runserver
